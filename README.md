This repository contains the data, models, and ancillary files for my WIELD internship project.

The repository contains four folders:

2. tesseract : a folder to contain the Tesseract model file and related ancillary files
3. nlp : a folder to contain the models and ancillary files for POS and grammatical form tagging and named entity recognition
4. website : a folder to contain the website files for WIELD
